## Alternatives
- [wmvanvliet/jupyter-vim](https://github.com/wmvanvliet/jupyter-vim)  
    A two-way integration between Vim and Jupyter. Develop code on a Jupyter notebooke without leaving the terminal. Send lines from Vim to a jupyter qtconsole. Have a MATLAB-like "cell-mode".

- [lambdalisue/jupyter-vim-binding](https://github.com/lambdalisue/jupyter-vim-binding)  
    This extension stands for providing a Vim like environmenti for Jupyter notebooks, so it would drastically overwrite the default mappings and introduce a new behaviors.

## Credits
Thanks to [Linda_pp](https://github.com/rhysd) who is the original developer of [rhysd/vim.wasm](https://github.com/rhysd/vim.wasm),
it is easy to add features to run with Jupyter. (U'ω')
